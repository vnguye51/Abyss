TODO:
    * When a new client connects, the old clients have to add the player
    * Add collision between players
    * Add collision with walls
    * Add collision 



OPTIMIZATIONS:
    * Currently the client loops through the entire list of players to identify which data is itself
        * Might want to consider using a map
